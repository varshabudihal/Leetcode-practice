Problem:
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero. 
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Solution:

In order to solve this question, I first reduced it to 2SUM problem by doing a+b = -c and the duplicates are handled by - let's say there is s and e index. 
Now given nums[s] there is a unique nums[e] such that nums[s]+nums[e]=Target. Therefore, if nums[s+1] is the same as nums[s], then searching in range s+1 to e will give us a duplicate solution. 
Thus we must move s till nums[s] != nums[s-1] to avoid getting duplicates.
                        while s<e and nums[s] == nums[s-1]:
                            s = s+1

Handling Duplicates in 3SUM

Imagine we are at index i and we have invoked the 2SUM problem from index i+1 to end of the array. Now once the 2SUM terminates, we will have a list of all triplets which include nums[i]. To avoid duplicates, we must skip all nums[i] where nums[i] == nums[i-1].
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
                
Code:
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        N, result = len(nums), []
        for i in range (N):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            target = nums[i]*-1
            s, e = i+1, N-1
            while s<e:
                if nums[s]+nums[e] == target:
                    result.append([nums[i], nums[s], nums[e]])
                    s = s+1
                    while s<e and nums[s]==nums[s-1]:
                        s = s+1
                elif nums[s] + nums[e] < target:
                    s = s+1
                else:
                    e =e-1
                        
        return result
